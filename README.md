# Wild_Jam_01_2019

- in b4 you are using the readme file incorrectly

don't care

# Things to do:

## Menu

- a title would be nice

- adding some heads up regarding game control to the sides

## About

- adding seperate screens

- maintence - low priority

## The Game

- How does one win?

by getting to the exit portal

a spawn and despawn animation will be needed

got to create a seperate entity for the exit point

- What are the fail conditions?

touch the edge of the end or overheat 
running out of fuel slows you down which means touching the edge is easier

- How does the camera behave?

done ~~zoomed in and centered on the player, follows when player nears the edge~~

- Insta gibb or health loss?

implemented ~~insta gib~~
~~needs death animation~~ half done
needs processing of death

- Backgroud needs fixing (Allow screen resize?)

hmmm, edging to lock screen resize

- How is fuel gained?

pickups placed on map

**implemented**

- needs flashy warning for low fuel and overheating

done ~~something like the low health beep from pokemon for low fuel~~

and a woop woop for overheating

- how are points gained?

lööps, collect them for points maybe?

- create scenes based on projectile

**added**

pick up (fuel and points), impact (adds velocity in oppposite direction, goes boom)

- implement end game screen

point tallying?

- add particle generator to engine

smoke generator and a lower plasma graphic

- bake better engine in blender

**done**

- bake better core in blender

**done**

- bake better body in blender

**done**

- bake fuel box in blender

**done** , didnt process it though :(

~~with a shiny orb in the middle~~ check

- transition between screens

general fade to black

possibly a screen between game levels - warp/travell screen

- warp in camera effect at game start and end

make it very zoomed at start and zoom out to game mode

at end zoom in and fade out

- how can the player know wher the exit is?

add a direction indicator? something like an arrow?

- a nice engine buzz?

pitch depends on current energy level? i guess

- some background tune would be nice

**added**
96% gona get something from incompetech, maybe mix it a bit?

- add a swirl sound effect for the edge

louder the closer you get? possibly
could use the 2d sound location effect and invert it?
the further you get from the center the louder it gets?
and ditection of sound is opposite to the source, yeah sounds good
